In recent years the subject of computer programming has been recognized as a discipline whose mastery
is fundamental and crucial to the success of many engineering projects and which is amenable to scientific
treatement and presentation. It has advanced from a craft to an academic discipline. The initial outstanding
contributions toward this development were made by E.W. Dijkstra and C.A.R. Hoare. Dijkstra's Notes
on Structured Programming [1] opened a new view of programming as a scientific subject and
intellectual challenge, and it coined the title for a "revolution" in programming. Hoare's Axiomatic Basis of
Computer Programming [2] showed in a lucid manner that programs are amenable to an exacting
analysis based on mathematical reasoning. Both these papers argue convincingly that many programmming
errors can be prevented by making programmers aware of the methods and techniques which they hitherto
applied intuitively and often unconsciously. These papers focused their attention on the aspects of
composition and analysis of programs, or more explicitly, on the structure of algorithms represented by
